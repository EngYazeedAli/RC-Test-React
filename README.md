# Employee Attendance Web Application

## Introduction

This web application is designed to facilitate the management of employee attendance for a small organization. The system includes features for employees to check in and check out, with specific business rules and validations to ensure accurate attendance tracking. Additionally, administrators can manage employee records and view attendance details.

## Entities

### Employee

## Business Rules

- Employees are allowed to check in until 8:00 am and check out until 3:00 pm.
- Each employee is expected to have one check-in and one check-out event per day.
- Double check-in or checkout operations are prevented (Optional feature).
- Late check-ins after 8:30 am and early check-outs before 3:00 pm are flagged.
